# Welcome to the Statistics Cookbook!

I've always been one to learn through examples. Here I work through various canonical examples for statistical concepts and techniques I'm interested in. My intuition grows through doing; it's not enough to read a textbook or even read code, I typically have to write it out from scratch myself to understand it. Later, it's a lot easier to follow my own notebooks when I want to relearn a concept or deploy something similar on a live project or problem.


### Bayesian Recipes

I've been a fan of Bayesian modeling since I read most of Richard McElreath's incredible book Statistical Rethinking. I had a great bayesian methods teacher at Stanford but I found the subject pretty difficult back then; it really came alive for me with Statistical Rethinking. The Bayesian Recipes folder features a number of notebooks where I work through canonical problems found in Statistical Rethinking or other sources, using PyMC.

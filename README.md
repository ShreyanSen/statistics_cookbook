# Welcome to the Statistics Cookbook!

I've always been one to learn through examples. Here I work through various canonical examples for statistical concepts and techniques I'm interested in. My intuition grows through doing; it's not enough to read a textbook or even read code, I typically have to write it out from scratch myself to understand it. Later, it's a lot easier to follow my own notebooks when I want to relearn a concept or deploy something similar on a live project or problem.
